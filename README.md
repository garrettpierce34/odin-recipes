About: This project is directly inspired from The Odin Project's 
"Recipe" assignment from their foundations course. I intend to use
all of the basic HTML knowledge I have learned so far to create
a website in which the user is able to view different recipes and
their descriptions. Along with this, there will be links and images
to help the user fully grasp each part of the recipes

Skills to learn: Using basic HTML, I intend to become more comfortable
using boilerplate code, headers, paragraphs, unordered and ordered lists,
strong and em, external links, and images.
